# HBD Gift to Lisha '24
<p>
  <h2> About </h2>
  This was another gift to my elder sister as her birthday gift on her birthday besides the Tetris® Electronika 60 '24. It was my third personal project. This was the first webpage that I 
  have created in my life and this was for my elder sister. Though it was a simple HTML file. I couldn't publish it before midnight (28.02.24), that's why GitHub will show that the release 
  date is 28.02.24. But I want to tell you that, the release date is 27.02.24. I mention this because anyone can get confused that the release date is showing 28.02.24 but why did I write 
  27.02.24 here? I wanted to release it on 27.02.24 but It was late.

  <h2> Conclusion </h2>
  Release Date: 27.02.24
